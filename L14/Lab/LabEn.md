# Task: Portfolio (10 points)

Your final assignment is to create your own homepage/portfolio website. To do this, you will use [Vite](https://vite.dev/) to set up the project and independently choose the remaining technologies.

You must choose one of the two frameworks covered in the lectures (Svelte or React) and one of the CSS solutions discussed (CSS/SCSS modules, Emotion, Tailwind or daisyUI).

The content of the portfolio will not be graded: if you do not want to include your real data, you can use placeholder text generators (such as Lorem Ipsum) and royalty-free images from sites like [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

You can draw inspiration from the internet. Sites like [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) are great for design ideas. The Odin Project offers two related exercises ([here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-getting-hired-building-your-personal-website) and [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-personal-portfolio)). You may also find ideas by browsing other developers’ portfolios.

Your project doesn't have to be perfect (this isn't a design course) and may replicate an existing layout. It also doesn't need to include animations. What matters is that the result is clean and well-organized.

## Requirements

1. The project must be created using [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
1. The site must use **React** or **Svelte**
1. The site must use **CSS Modules**, **SCSS Modules**, **Emotion**, **Tailwind** or **daisyUI**
1. The project must be organized into components in a way that supports maintainability
1. The page must contain (at least) the following three sections:
   - "About Me"
   - "My Projects"
   - "Contact"
1. We did not cover routing solutions during the lectures; all content should therefore exist on a **single page**
